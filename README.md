# 🌐 IPv4 Details

Welcome to the **IPv4 Information Page**. This page is dedicated to explaining the core concepts, structure, and usage of **Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)** — the backbone of modern networking.

## 📘 Overview

IPv4 is a connectionless protocol used to identify devices on a network through an addressing system. It is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and the most widely used to date.

## 📌 Key Topics Covered

### ✅ 1. Introduction to IPv4
- Brief history and evolution
- Role in the OSI model and TCP/IP stack

### ✅ 2. Address Structure
- 32-bit address divided into 4 octets
- Dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
- Address classes (A, B, C, D, E)

### ✅ 3. Subnetting and CIDR
- Subnet masks and network division
- CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Calculating number of hosts and subnets

### ✅ 4. Public vs Private IPs
- Definition and usage of private IP ranges
- NAT (Network Address Translation)

### ✅ 5. Binary Representation
- Converting decimal to binary and vice versa
- Understanding bitwise operations in networking

### ✅ 6. Tools & Commands
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` / `ping` / `tracert`
- Online IPv4 calculators and lookup tools

### ✅ 7. Security Notes
- IPv4 limitations and vulnerabilities
- Best practices for IPv4 security
